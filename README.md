###Personal Website - Anthony Dang
=========

This repository contains all the pertinent information for my personal website for CIS440.

=========

##Introduction:
The main purpose of this website is to demonstrates something new that I learned since being in CIS440. This project will be using HTML, CSS, and JS through bootstrap. In addition to providing a personal website, I will be doing the following:
	- Creating new GitHub repository for the project	
	
##What I learned and new skills
In addition to learning about scrum, I was able to expand my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JS by researching about WordPress and using Bootstrap. Given the task of creating a website for a client, I was able to learn about Bootstrap and apply these newly found skills to the project. 

What exactly is Bootstrap? 
 - Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projets on the web. It allows users to make front-end web development faster and easier by providing the two most popular CSS preprocessors.
